      <description>What is it? This python script, which most likely has quite a few bugs can tell you information about a quadratic function that is in standard form! It&amp;rsquo;s able to tell you the axis of symmetry, range, y-intercept, x-intercept(s), and more.
Why? I&amp;rsquo;m lasy and wanted something that could do my homework for me. Hopefully by putting this out there you might be able to learn from it, and cheat with it i do not condone cheating.</description>
