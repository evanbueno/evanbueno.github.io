## What is it?
This python script, which most likely has quite a few bugs can tell you information about a quadratic function that is in standard form! It's able to tell you the axis of symmetry, range, y-intercept, x-intercept(s), and more. You can see the repo [here](https://github.com/Biune/math-quadratic-solver).

## Why?
I'm lazy and wanted something that could do my homework for me. Hopefully by putting this out there you might be able to learn from it, and cheat with it *i do not condone cheating*.

## Bugs?
I know, fork this if you really want to fix it, and then I'll accept it if it's good. Please keep in mind that this only works with **standard form** quadratic functions.
